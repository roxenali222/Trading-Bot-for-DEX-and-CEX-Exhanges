# Trading-Bot-for-DEX-and-CEX-Exhanges
 Project Description:  This project involves creating a front-running bot for decentralized exchanges (DEX) like PancakeSwap. The bot monitors blockchain mempools to detect large pending transactions and executes small buy orders just before these trades to leverage price changes. It uses Python with the web3 library for blockchain interaction
